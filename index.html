          <!-- Insert About Me details-->
          <p>Hello! I'm Claire. I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States when I was nine years old. I now live in Northridge, CA with my fiance and our three cats: Kita, Digi, and Kaia. For fun, I enjoy watching sports, 
            running obstacle course races, and working out at my Crossfit box. I graduated from California State University, Los Angeles with a Bachelors of Science degree in Psychology, 
          and from Mount Saint Mary's University, Los Angeles with my Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology.</p>
            <p>My professional background includes several years working in the non-profit sector serving marginalized communities, such as the LGBTQ, HIV+, and homeless populations. 
              I have worked as a case manager, group facilitator, programming coordinator, and a substance abuse counselor. </p>
              <p>Recently, I have decided to pursue to learn a new skill, CODING! I am currently attending UCLA Extention's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Wish me luck as I go on this new adventure. </p>
