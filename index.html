          <!-- Insert About Me details-->
          <p>Hi! I'm Claire. I live in Northridge, CA with my fiance and our three cats: Kita, Digi, and Kaia. For fun, I enjoy watching sports, 
            running obstacle course races, and working out at my Crossfit box. I graduated from California State University, Los Angeles with a BS in Psychology, 
          and Mount Saint Mary's University, Los Angeles with my MA in Counseling Psychology.</p>
            <p>My professional background includes several years working in the non-profit sector serving marginalized communities, such as the LGBTQ, HIV+, and homeless populations. 
              I have experiences in case management, group facilitation, and one-on-one counseling. </p>
              <p>Recently, I have decided to pursue to learn a new skill, CODING! I am currently attending UCLA Extention's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Wish me luck as I go on this new adventure. </p>
